# Changelog

## [Session 2024-02-26 - Part 3]

### Fixed
- Enhanced CPALMS scraper with exponential backoff for better reliability
- Removed trailing colons from resource titles in the database
- Improved resumability of the scraper with atomic state file updates
- Added better logging for scraper state management

### Changed
- Increased default delay between requests from 1 second to 5 seconds
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for failed requests
- Extended request timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- Enhanced state saving mechanism to be more robust

### Technical Details
